ORDER OF PRIORITY
1. credit score (most important as it is a collective score of all other factors/variables) 
            -automatically decline if <561 (very poor), accept if >960(excellent)
2. active CCJs - automatically decline if active CCJs >0
3. total CCJs - previous CCJs is a high priority risk
3. bankruptcy or IVAs - ever been declared bankrupt
4. defaults and arrears - rank based on how many months since last arrears. More recent = high risk
5. high credit utilization - if card_utilisation>0.5 (just an estimate)
6. number of active cards - more active cards is a concern for an application
7. number of active loans - more loans is a cause for concern with an application (>=5 is risky)
8. debt to income ratio - total_active_balance to amount of total_borrowing cost (maybe idk?)
9. high loan amounts - higher loans will need to be scrutinized in more detail


FACTORS TO BE CHECKED MANUALLY BY UNDERWRITERS 
would also be interesting to look at whether the application is under debit or credit
    credit may be seen as riskier as the applicant is requesting to borrow money
it would also be useful to look at the type of transaction that the applicant is trying to make
    some categories would take a higher priority for approval over other. (look at loan category and subcategory
    for example, car payments should be more likely to be approved than a loan request to pay for video games etc
